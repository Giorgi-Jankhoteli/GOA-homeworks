            Mercedes-Benz originated from Karl Benz's first internal combustion engine in the Benz Patent Motorwagen, patented in January 1886 and financed by Bertha Benz's dowry. In the same year, Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach adapted a stagecoach with a petrol engine. The Mercedes automobile was first marketed in 1901 by Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft.

            Emil Jellinek-Mercedes, an Austrian entrepreneur working with DMG, registered the "Mercedes" trademark in 1902, naming the 1901 Mercedes 35 hp after his daughter. A savvy businessman, he marketed Daimler automobiles to elite clientele, including the Rothschilds and billionaires like Rockefeller and Morgan. Jellinek raced under the pseudonym "Monsieur Mercédès," marking a key moment in the brand's history. In 1901, DMG re-registered "Mercedes" as a protected trademark. The first Mercedes-Benz vehicles were produced in 1926, after the merger of Benz and Daimler’s companies into Daimler-Benz.

            From 1937, Daimler-Benz focused on military products, halting car production by 1942 to support war efforts. By 1944, half of its 63,610 employees were forced laborers, and the company later paid $12 million in reparations.

            In 1958, Daimler-Benz partnered with Studebaker to sell cars in the U.S., adapting dealerships after Studebaker closed in 1966. Mercedes-Benz became known for innovations and safety features.

            In November 2019, Daimler AG spun off Mercedes-Benz into a separate subsidiary, while trucks and buses became Daimler Truck AG. In May 2022, a rare 1955 SLR sold for $142 million, funding the Mercedes-Benz Fund. However, in June 2022, the company recalled nearly one million vehicles from 2004 to 2015 due to braking issues.

        How it all Began 1834: Gottlieb Daimler.
    </h3>
    <p>
        <b>
            Gottlieb Daimler was born on March 17, 1834, in Schorndorf. After training as a gunsmith and studying at the Polytechnic School in Stuttgart, he worked in France and England before becoming a draftsman in 1862. He became Technical Director at Deutz Gasmotorenfabrik in 1872 but left in 1882 due to conflicts.

            Daimler then set up a workshop in his villa to develop petrol-driven four-stroke engines, collaborating with Wilhelm Maybach. They created the "Grandfather Clock," a compact internal combustion engine. Financial struggles led Daimler to found Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft (DMG) in 1890 with Max Duttenhofer and Wilhelm Lorenz, though conflicts arose over production focus.

            After Maybach resigned in 1891, Daimler continued building engines under his name, leading to tensions with his partners. Eventually, both Daimler and Maybach returned to DMG, where the Phoenix engine boosted popularity. Daimler was appointed Inspector General of the Supervisory Board but sadly passed away from heart disease on March 6, 1900.

        How it all Began 1844: Carl Benz.
    </h3>
    <p>
        <b>
            'Love of invention will never end.'
            <br>
            Carl Benz is born in Karlsruhe on 25 November 1844. His father dies in July 1846. Despite living on limited financial means, his mother ensures that her son attends a grammar school and later studies mechanical engineering. The young engineer advances quickly from a locksmith to a designer and workshop foreman. In 1871, Carl Benz joins forces with 'mechanician' August Ritter to found his first company, 'Carl Benz and August Ritter, Engineering Workshop', in Mannheim. When Ritter emerges as an unreliable partner, Carl Benz is forced to pay him off using the dowry of his wife, Bertha Ringer, and runs the company alone. From 1878, Carl Benz works intensively on a gas-driven two-stroke engine to realise his vision of a 'vehicle without horses'. After long and laborious attempts, he gets the engine running for the first time on New Year’s Eve in 1879. He founds the 'Gasmotorenfabrik Mannheim' (Mannheim Gas Engine Factory) as a shareholding company in October 1882. Benz’s share in the company amounts to a mere 5 per cent, however, and he has only limited influence in technical areas. His backers are primarily concerned with the safe business of stationary gas engines.

            Benz leaves the company in January 1883 and joins forces with new business partners Max Rose and Friedrich Wilhelm Esslinger. They found the company 'Benz & Cie. Rheinische Gasmotoren-Fabrik Mannheim' (Benz & Co. Rhine Gas Engine Factory Mannheim' and launch the two-stroke 'System Benz' engine. While Benz strives to implement his automotive vision, his business partners Rose and Esslinger are sceptical of the outcome. Carl Benz is once again faced with finding new investors. Julius Ganss and Friedrich von Fischer replace Rose and Esslinger in May 1890. The combined business model of producing stationary and vehicle engines is a success. But Benz wanted to focus exclusively on vehicles and starts the company 'Carl Benz Söhne' (Carl Benz & Sons) in Ladenburg in 1906. In 1912, Carl Benz resigns as Managing Director and transfers sole management control to his sons. He witnesses the rise of motorisation and the implementation of his ideas. On his 80th birthday, the 'once ridiculed and misunderstood inventor,' as he has been seen in the past, enjoys plaudits from around the world. In his last years (1926 to 1929), Carl Benz remains active as a Board Member of the new Daimler-Benz AG company. The automobile pioneer dies at his home in Ladenburg on 4 April 1929.

        How it all Began 1846: Wilhelm Maybach.
    </h3>
    <p>
        <b>
            The king of designers.
            <br>
            Wilhelm Maybach was born on February 9, 1846, in Heilbronn and became orphaned at ten. He was adopted into the Reutlinger Bruderhaus, where he met Gottlieb Daimler in 1864. Following Daimler to Karlsruhe and later to Deutz Gasmotorenfabrik, Maybach became head designer in 1873. After Daimler left Deutz in 1882, they collaborated on a lightweight combustion engine in Cannstatt.

            In 1890, Daimler founded Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft (DMG) but Maybach left in 1891 due to unsatisfactory contract terms. Secretly funded by Daimler, he developed key innovations like the belt drive and the Phoenix engine while working from the Hotel Hermann. Both men returned to DMG in 1895 to improve the company’s competitiveness.

            Maybach's work led to the production of the first belt-driven car, but after Max von Duttenhofer’s death in 1903, his standing declined, prompting his resignation in 1907. He then founded his own company with his sons, creating the iconic Maybach vehicles. Wilhelm Maybach died on December 29, 1929, at 83 and was buried near Gottlieb Daimler at the Uff-Kirchhof cemetery.
