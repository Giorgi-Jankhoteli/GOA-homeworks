            The Mercedes-Benz CLS <br> (initially called the CLS-Class) is a series of executive cars produced by Mercedes-Benz from October 2004 to August 2023.
            <br>
            The original model was a four-door sedan based on the Mercedes E-Class platform, marketed as a four door coupé. An estate (shooting brake) model was later added to the model range with the second generation CLS.All models are available as a high performance AMG variant, although it wasn't until the second generation CLS that 4MATIC all-wheel drive was offered.
            <br>
            The CLS range is positioned between the E-Class and the S-Class within the Mercedes model range, and models tend to be less practical than the E-Class it is based on. It primarily competes with other fastback sedans like the BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe, Porsche Panamera and Audi A7. Production of the CLS ended on 31 August 2023 to prepare for the launch of the new Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W214).

            The CLS, marketed by Mercedes as a four-door coupé, was designed by Michael Fink in 2001. Known as the C219 in Europe and W219 in the US, it shares its platform with the W211 E-Class, including engines and a wheelbase of 2,854 mm (112 in). IVM Automotive developed the production version from the Vision CLS concept, which debuted at the 2004 New York International Auto Show.

            The C218 CLS, the second generation sold from 2011 to 2018, includes a 4-door coupé (C218/W218) and a 5-door estate (X218, marketed as 'Shooting Brake'). Its design drew inspiration from the Mercedes F800 concept and features elements from the SLS AMG. Unlike its predecessor, the C218 offers all-wheel drive, especially on CLS 63 AMG models. A facelift in 2014 introduced design updates, engine enhancements, and the Mercedes 9G-Tronic automatic transmission.

            The C257 CLS is the third generation, available as a four-door coupé with rear-wheel or all-wheel drive (4MATIC). Although a Shooting Brake version was in development, it was discontinued due to declining demand. Engine options include a 2.9-liter straight-six turbocharged diesel and a 3.0-liter straight-six turbocharged petrol, with the latter powering the CLS 53 AMG, which features a mild hybrid system and a Panamericana grille reminiscent of the 300 SL. Unlike its predecessors, the C257 is a five-seater.
